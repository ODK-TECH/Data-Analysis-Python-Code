# Student-Math-Performance-ML
This repository contains Python code implementations for Chapters 3 and 4 of my research project, which focuses on applying machine learning techniques to model students' performance in mathematics. The project explores data preprocessing, supervised learning models, feature selection, and model evaluation.
Contents:
- ðŸ“‚ Chapter 3 - Research Methodology:
- Data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering
- Implementation of supervised learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning and validation strategies
- ðŸ“‚ Chapter 4 - Results and Discussion:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of key features
- Model training and evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ², Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Comparative analysis of models and feature importance ranking.
  
This repository serves as a computational framework for educational data science research, providing insights into mathematical performance predictors using machine learning techniques.
